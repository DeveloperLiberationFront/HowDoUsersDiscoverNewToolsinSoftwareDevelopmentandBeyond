    abstract = {{ABSTRACTThe} article explores the ways in which older workers' career trajectories influenced their exit from or continuity of employment in the Australian information technology ({IT}) industry. The data were collected through qualitative interviews with 71 employees of 10 small and medium-sized {IT} firms as part of the cross-country Workforce Ageing in the New Economy project ({WANE}), which was conducted in Canada, the United States, Australia and several European Union countries (the United Kingdom, Germany and The Netherlands). The analysis revealed that older {IT} workers' capacity to envisage careers beyond their fifties was constrained by age-based capability assumptions that resulted in truncated careers, dissuaded the ambition to continue in work, and induced early retirement. The workers' constricted, age-bound perspectives on their careers were reinforced by the rapid pace of technological and company transformations. A structural incompatibility was found between the exceptional dynamism and competitiveness of the {IT} industry and the conventional age-staged and extended career. The analysis showed that several drivers of occupational career trajectories besides the well-researched health and financial factors predisposed to exit and retirement. The paper concludes with policy and practice recommendations for the prolongation of {IT} workers' careers and their improved alignment with the contemporary lifecourse.},

    abstract = {Becoming an expert at programming is thought to take an estimated 10,000 hours of deliberate practice . But what happens after that? Do programming experts continue to develop, do they plateau, or is there a decline at some point? A diversity of opinion exists on this matter, but many seem to think that aging brings a decline in adoption and absorption of new programming knowledge. We develop several research questions on this theme, and draw on data from {StackOverflow} to address these questions. The goal of this research is to support career planning and staff development for programmers by identifying age-related trends in {StackOverflow} data. We observe that programmer reputation scores increase relative to age well into the 50's, that programmers in their 30's tend to focus on fewer areas relative to those younger or older in age, and that there is not a strong correlation between age and scores in specific knowledge areas.},
